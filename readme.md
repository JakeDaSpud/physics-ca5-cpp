# Friction Physics Simulation

I have to make a Physics simulation in MATHEMATICA (ew!) and I really dislike it, notebooks in general.
So I'm trying to make Vector2, Vector3, and the whole simulation in C++ first!

# Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *main* | Where the simulation will be processed |
| *vec3* and *vec2* | 2D and 3D Vector implementations, with + - / \* \[] operators, dot(vec), cross(vec), magnitude(), and normalize() |

---

# Variables and Initial Conditions

current normal,
current position,
current velocity,
current force due to gravity in direction of plane,
current force due to gravity in direction of normal,
current normal force,
current frictional force,
current net force,
current mass,
current acceleration,
etc.
